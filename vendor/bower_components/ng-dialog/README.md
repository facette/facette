> Modal dialogs and popups provider for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) applications.

ngDialog is ~10KB (minified), has minimalistic API, is highly customizable through themes and has only AngularJS as dependency.

### [Demo](http://likeastore.github.io/ngDialog)

## Install

You can download all necessary ngDialog files manually, or install it with bower:

```bash
bower install ng-dialog
```

or npm:

```bash
npm install ng-dialog
```

## Usage

You need only to include ``ngDialog.js``,  ``ngDialog.css`` and  ``ngDialog-theme-default.css`` (as minimal setup) to your project and then you can start using the ``ngDialog`` provider in your directives, controllers and services.  For example:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/ng-dialog/css/ngDialog.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/ng-dialog/css/ngDialog-theme-default.min.css">
    <script src="lib/ng-dialog/js/ngDialog.min.js"></script>

Define the className to be the ``ngDialog-theme-default``. 

For example in controllers:

```javascript
var app = angular.module('exampleApp', ['ngDialog']);

app.controller('MainCtrl', function ($scope, ngDialog) {
    $scope.clickToOpen = function () {
        ngDialog.open({ template: 'popupTmpl.html', className: 'ngdialog-theme-default' });
    };
});
```

## Collaboration

Your help is appreciated! If you've found a bug or if something is not clear, please raise an issue.

Ideally, if you've found an issue, you will submit a PR that meets our [contributor guidelines][contributor-guidelines].

### Running Tests

```bash
git clone git@github.com:likeastore/ngDialog.git
cd ngDialog
npm i
npm run test
```

## API

ngDialog service provides easy to use and minimalistic API, but in the same time it's powerful enough. Here is the list of accessible methods that you can use:

===

### ``.open(options)``

Method allows to open dialog window, creates new dialog instance on each call. It accepts ``options`` object as the only argument.

#### Options:

##### ``template {String}``

Dialog template can be loaded through ``path`` to external html template or ``<script>`` tag with ``text/ng-template``:

```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="templateId">
    <h1>Template heading</h1>
    <p>Content goes here</p>
</script>
```

```javascript
ngDialog.open({ template: 'templateId' });
```

Also it is possible to use a simple string as template together with ``plain`` option.

##### Pro Tip about templates

It's not always necessary to place your external html template inside ``<script>`` tag. You could put these templates into ``$templateCache`` like this:

```javascript
angular.module('dialog.templates').run(['$templateCache', function($templateCache) {
    $templateCache.put('templateId', 'template content');
}]);
```

Then it would be possible to include the ``dialog.templates`` module into the dependencies of your main module and start using this template as ``templateId``.

There is no need to do these actions manually.
You could use one of the plugins specifically for these purposes. They are available for different build systems including most popular Gulp / Grunt:

- [gulp-angular-templatecache](https://github.com/miickel/gulp-angular-templatecache)
- [gulp-ng-html2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-ng-html2js)
- [grunt-html2js](https://github.com/karlgoldstein/grunt-html2js)
- [broccoli-html2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/broccoli-html2js)

You could find more detailed examples on each of these pages.

##### ``plain {Boolean}``

If ``true`` allows to use plain string as template, default ``false``:

```javascript
ngDialog.open({
    template: '<p>my template</p>',
    plain: true
});
```

##### ``controller {String} | {Array} | {Object}``

Controller that will be used for the dialog window if necessary. The controller can be specified either by referring it by name or directly inline.

```javascript
ngDialog.open({
    template: 'externalTemplate.html',
    controller: 'SomeController'
});
```

or

```javascript
ngDialog.open({
    template: 'externalTemplate.html',
    controller: ['$scope', 'otherService', function($scope, otherService) {
        // controller logic
    }]
});
```

##### ``controllerAs {String} ``

You could optionally specify `controllerAs` parameter for your controller. Then inside your template it will be possible to refer this controller by the value specified by `controllerAs`.

Usage of `controllerAs` syntax is currently recommended by the AngularJS team.

##### ``resolve {Object.<String, Function>}``

An optional map of dependencies which should be injected into the controller.
If any of these dependencies are promises, ngDialog will wait for them all to be resolved
or one to be rejected before the controller is instantiated.

If all the promises are resolved successfully, the values of the resolved promises are
injected.

The map object
is:
- `key` â€“ `{String}`: a name of a dependency to be injected into the controller.
- `factory` - `{String | Function}`: If `String` then it is an alias for a service.
  Otherwise if `Function`, then it is injected using `$injector.invoke` and the return
  value is treated as the dependency. If the result is a promise, it is resolved
  before its value is injected into the controller.


```javascript
ngDialog.open({
    controller: function Ctrl(dep) {/*...*/},
    resolve: {
        dep: function depFactory() {
            return 'dep value';
        }
    }
});
```

##### ``scope {Object}``

Scope object that will be passed to the dialog. If you use a controller with separate ``$scope`` service this object will be passed to the ``$scope.$parent`` param:

```javascript
$scope.value = true;

ngDialog.open({
    template: 'externalTemplate.html',
    className: 'ngdialog-theme-plain',
    scope: $scope
});
```

```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="externalTemplate.html">
<p>External scope: <code>{{value}}</code></p>
</script>
```

##### ``scope.closeThisDialog(value)``

In addition ``.closeThisDialog(value)`` method gets injected to passed ``$scope``. This allows you to close the dialog straight from the handler in a popup element, for example:

```html
<div class="dialog-contents">
    <input type="text"/>
    <input type="button" value="OK" ng-click="checkInput() && closeThisDialog('Some value')"/>
</div>
```

Any value passed to this function will be attached to the object which resolves on the close promise for this dialog. For dialogs opened with the ``openConfirm()`` method the value is used as the reject reason.

##### ``data {String | Object | Array}``

Any serializable data that you want to be stored in the controller's dialog scope. (``$scope.ngDialogData``). From version `0.3.6` `$scope.ngDialogData` keeps references to the objects instead of copying them.

Additionally, you will have the dialog id available as ``$scope.ngDialogId``. If you are using ``$scope.ngDialogData``, it'll be also available under ``$scope.ngDialogData.ngDialogId``.

##### ``className {String}``

This option allows you to control the dialog's look, you can use built-in [themes](https://github.com/likeastore/ngDialog#themes) or create your own styled modals.

This example enables one of the built-in ngDialog themes - ``ngdialog-theme-default`` (do not forget to include necessary css files):

```javascript
ngDialog.open({
    template: 'templateId',
    className: 'ngdialog-theme-default'
});
```
Note: If the className is not mentioned, the dialog will not display correctly.

Check [themes](https://github.com/likeastore/ngDialog#themes) block to learn more.

##### ``appendClassName {String}``

Unlike the `className` property, which overrides any default classes specified through the `setDefaults()` method ([see docs](https://github.com/likeastore/ngDialog#setdefaultsoptions)), `appendClassName` allows for the addition of a class on top of any defaults.

For example, the following would add both the `ngdialog-theme-default` and `ngdialog-custom` classes to the dialog opened:

```javascript
ngDialogProvider.setDefaults({
    className: 'ngdialog-theme-default'
});
```
```javascript
ngDialog.open({
    template: 'template.html',
    appendClassName: 'ngdialog-custom'
});
```

##### ``disableAnimation {Boolean}``

If ``true`` then animation for the dialog will be disabled, default ``false``.

##### ``overlay {Boolean}``

If ``false`` it allows to hide the overlay div behind the modals, default ``true``.

##### ``showClose {Boolean}``

If ``false`` it allows to hide the close button on modals, default ``true``.

##### ``closeByEscape {Boolean}``

It allows to close modals by clicking the ``Esc`` key, default ``true``.

This will close all open modals if there are several of them opened at the same time.

##### ``closeByNavigation {Boolean}``

It allows to close modals on state change (history.back, $state.go, etc.), default ``false``.
Compatible with ui-router and angular-router.
Set this value to true if you want your modal to close when you go back or change state.
Set this value to false if you want your modal to stay open when you change state within your app.

This will close all open modals if there are several of them opened at the same time.

##### ``closeByDocument {Boolean}``

It allows to close modals by clicking on overlay background, default ``true``. If [Hammer.js](https://github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js) is loaded, it will listen for ``tap`` instead of ``click``.

##### ``appendTo {String}``

Specify your element where to append dialog instance, accepts selector string (e.g. ``#yourId``, ``.yourClass``). If not specified appends dialog to ``body`` as default behavior.

##### ``cache {Boolean}``

Pass ``false`` to disable template caching. Useful for developing purposes, default is ``true``.

##### ``name {String} | {Number}``

Give a name for a dialog instance. It is useful for identifying specific dialog if there are multiple dialog boxes opened.

##### ``preCloseCallback {String} | {Function}``

Provide either the name of a function or a function to be called before the dialog is closed.  If the callback function specified in the option returns ``false`` then the dialog will not be closed. Alternatively, if the callback function returns a promise that gets resolved the dialog will be closed.

The ``preCloseCallback`` function receives as a parameter ``value`` which is the same value sent to ``.close(id, value)``.

The primary use case for this feature is a dialog which contains user actions (e.g. editing data) for which you want the ability to confirm whether to discard unsaved changes upon exiting the dialog (e.g. via the escape key).

This example uses an inline function with a ``window.confirm`` call in the ``preCloseCallback`` function:

```javascript
ngDialog.open({
    preCloseCallback: function(value) {
        if (confirm('Are you sure you want to close without saving your changes?')) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
});
```

In another example, a callback function with a nested confirm ngDialog is used:

```javascript
ngDialog.open({
    preCloseCallback: function(value) {
        var nestedConfirmDialog = ngDialog.openConfirm({
            template:'\
                <p>Are you sure you want to close the parent dialog?</p>\
                <div class="ngdialog-buttons">\
                    <button type="button" class="ngdialog-button ngdialog-button-secondary" ng-click="closeThisDialog(0)">No</button>\
                    <button type="button" class="ngdialog-button ngdialog-button-primary" ng-click="confirm(1)">Yes</button>\
                </div>',
            plain: true
        });

        // NOTE: return the promise from openConfirm
        return nestedConfirmDialog;
    }
});
```

##### ``trapFocus {Boolean}``

When ``true``, ensures that the focused element remains within the dialog to conform to accessibility recommendations. Default value is ``true``

##### ``preserveFocus {Boolean}``

When ``true``, closing the dialog restores focus to the element that launched it. Designed to improve keyboard accessibility. Default value is ``true``

##### ``ariaAuto {Boolean}``

When ``true``, automatically selects appropriate values for any unspecified accessibility attributes. Default value is ``true``

See [Accessibility](#Accessibility) for more information.

##### ``ariaRole {String}``

Specifies the value for the ``role`` attribute that should be applied to the dialog element. Default value is ``null`` (unspecified)

See [Accessibility](#Accessibility) for more information.

##### ``ariaLabelledById {String}``

Specifies the value for the ``aria-labelledby`` attribute that should be applied to the dialog element. Default value is ``null`` (unspecified)

If specified, the value is not validated against the DOM. See [Accessibility](#Accessibility) for more information.

##### ``ariaLabelledBySelector {String}``

Specifies the CSS selector for the element to be referenced by the ``aria-labelledby`` attribute on the dialog element. Default value is ``null`` (unspecified)

If specified, the first matching element is used. See [Accessibility](#Accessibility) for more information.

##### ``ariaDescribedById {String}``

Specifies the value for the ``aria-describedby`` attribute that should be applied to the dialog element. Default value is ``null`` (unspecified)

If specified, the value is not validated against the DOM. See [Accessibility](#Accessibility) for more information.

##### ``ariaDescribedBySelector {String}``

Specifies the CSS selector for the element to be referenced by the ``aria-describedby`` attribute on the dialog element. Default value is ``null`` (unspecified)

If specified, the first matching element is used. See [Accessibility](#Accessibility) for more information.

##### ``width {Number | String}``

This option allows you to control the dialog's width. Default value is `null` (unspecified)

If you provide a Number, 'px' will be appended. To use a custom metric, use a String, e.g. `'40%'`.

For example, the following will add `width: 400px;` to the dialog when opened:

```
ngDialog.open({
    template: 'template.html',
    width: 400
});
```

In another example, the following will add `width: 40%;`:

```
ngDialog.open({
    template: 'template.html',
    width: '40%'
});
```

##### ``height {Number | String}``

This option allows you to control the dialog's height. Default value is `null` (unspecified)

If you provide a Number, 'px' will be appended. To use a custom metric, use a String, e.g. `'40%'`.

For example, the following will add `height: 400px;` to the dialog when opened:

```
ngDialog.open({
    template: 'template.html',
    height: 400
});
```

In another example, the following will add `height: 40%;`:

```
ngDialog.open({
    template: 'template.html',
    height: '40%'
});
```

#### Returns:

The ``open()`` method returns an object with some useful properties.

##### ``id {String}``

This is the ID of the dialog which was just created. It is the ID on the dialog's DOM element.

##### ``close(value) {Function}``

This is a function which will close the dialog which was opened by the current call to ``open()``. It takes an optional value to pass to the close promise.

##### ``closePromise {Promise}``

A promise which will resolve when the dialog is closed. It is resolved with an object containing: ``id`` - the ID of the closed dialog, ``value`` - the value the dialog was closed with, ``$dialog`` - the dialog element which at this point has been removed from the DOM and ``remainingDialogs`` - the number of dialogs still open.

The value property will be a special string if the dialog is dismissed by one of the built in mechanisms: `'$escape'`, `'$closeButton'` or `'$document'`.

This allows you do to something like this:

```javascript
var dialog = ngDialog.open({
    template: 'templateId'
});

dialog.closePromise.then(function (data) {
    console.log(data.id + ' has been dismissed.');
});
```

===

### ``.setDefaults(options)``

You're able to set default settings through ``ngDialogProvider``:

```javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngDialog']);
app.config(['ngDialogProvider', function (ngDialogProvider) {
    ngDialogProvider.setDefaults({
        className: 'ngdialog-theme-default',
        plain: true,
        showClose: true,
        closeByDocument: true,
        closeByEscape: true
    });
}]);
```

===

### ``.openConfirm(options)``

Opens a dialog that by default does not close when hitting escape or clicking outside the dialog window. The function returns a promise that is either resolved or rejected depending on the way the dialog was closed.

#### Options:

The options are the same as the regular [``.open()``](https://github.com/likeastore/ngDialog#options) method with an extra function added to the scope:

##### ``scope.confirm()``

In addition to the ``.closeThisDialog()`` method. The method ``.confirm()`` is also injected to passed ``$scope``. Use this method to close the dialog and ``resolve`` the promise that was returned when opening the modal.

The function accepts a single optional parameter which is used as the value of the resolved promise.

```html
<div class="dialog-contents">
    Some message
    <button ng-click="closeThisDialog()">Cancel</button>
    <button ng-click="confirm()">Confirm</button>
</div>
```

#### Returns:

An Angular promise object that is resolved if the ``.confirm()`` function is used to close the dialog, otherwise the promise is rejected. The resolve value and the reject reason is defined by the value passed to the ``confirm()`` or ``closeThisDialog()`` call respectively.

===

### ``.isOpen(id)``

Method accepts dialog's ``id`` and returns a ``Boolean`` value indicating whether the specified dialog is open.

===

### ``.close(id, value)``

Method accepts dialog's ``id`` as string argument to close specific dialog window, if ``id`` is not specified it will close all currently active modals (same behavior as ``.closeAll()``). Takes an optional value to resolve the dialog promise with (or all dialog promises).

===

### ``.closeAll(value)``

Method manages closing all active modals on the page. Takes an optional value to resolve all of the dialog promises with.

===

### ``.getOpenDialogs()``

Method that returns array which includes the ids of opened dialogs.

===

### ``.setForceHtmlReload({Boolean})``

Adds an additional listener on every ``$locationChangeSuccess`` event and gets update version of ``html`` into dialog. May be useful in some rare cases when you're dependant on DOM changes, defaults to ``false``. Use it in module's config as provider instance:

```javascript
var app = angular.module('exampleApp', ['ngDialog']);

app.config(function (ngDialogProvider) {
    ngDialogProvider.setForceHtmlReload(true);
});
```

===

### ``.setForceBodyReload({Boolean})``

Adds additional listener on every ``$locationChangeSuccess`` event and gets updated version of ``body`` into dialog. Maybe useful in some rare cases when you're dependant on DOM changes, defaults to ``false``. Use it in module's config as provider instance:

```javascript
var app = angular.module('exampleApp', ['ngDialog']);

app.config(function (ngDialogProvider) {
    ngDialogProvider.setForceBodyReload(true);
});
```

===

### ``.setOpenOnePerName({Boolean})``
Default value: false 

Define whether or not opening a dialog with the same name more than once simultaneously is allowed. Assigning true prevents opening a second dialog.

Setting it in the ngDialogProvider:
```javascript
var app = angular.module('exampleApp', ['ngDialog']);

app.config(function (ngDialogProvider) {
    ngDialogProvider.setOpenOnePerName(true);
});
```

Make sure to remember to add a 'name' when opening a dialog.
**ngDialog 'open' and 'openConfirm' functions will return `undefined` if the dialog was not opened.**

## Directive

By default the ngDialog module is served with the ``ngDialog`` directive which can be used as attribute for buttons, links, etc. Almost all ``.open()`` options are available through tag attributes as well, the only difference is that ``ng-template`` id or path of template file is required.

Some imaginary button, for example, will look like:

```html
<button type="button"
    ng-dialog="templateId.html"
    ng-dialog-class="ngdialog-theme-flat"
    ng-dialog-controller="ModalCtrl"
    ng-dialog-close-previous>
    Open modal text
</button>
```

You could optionally use ``ng-dialog-bind-to-controller`` to bind scope you've defined via parameter of directive to controller.
More information about bindToController is available [here](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angularjs/2015/01/02/exploring-angular-1.3-bindToController.html).

Directive contains one more additional but very useful option, it's an attribute named ``ng-dialog-close-previous``. It allows you to close previously opened dialogs automatically.

## Events

Everytime ngDialog is opened or closed we're broadcasting three events (dispatching events downwards to all child scopes):

- ``ngDialog.opened``

- ``ngDialog.closing``

- ``ngDialog.closed``

This allows you to register your own listeners, example:

```javascript
$rootScope.$on('ngDialog.opened', function (e, $dialog) {
    console.log('ngDialog opened: ' + $dialog.attr('id'));
});
```

``ngDialog.closing`` is different than ``ngDialog.closed`` in that it is fired immediately when the dialog begins closing, whereas ``ngDialog.closed`` is fired after all animations are complete. Both will be fired even when animation end support is not detected.

Additionally we trigger following 2 events related to loading of template for dialog:

- ``ngDialog.templateLoading``

- ``ngDialog.templateLoaded``

In case you are loading your templates from an external location, you could use above events to show some kind of loader.

Finally, we trigger the following event when adding padding to or removing padding from the body tag to compensate for scrollbar toggling:

- ``ngDialog.setPadding``

The ``ngDialog.setPadding`` event will communicate the pixel value being added to the body tag so you can add it to any other elements in your layout at the same time (often fixed-position elements will need this).


## Themes

Currently _ngDialog_ contains two default themes that show how easily you can create your own. Check ``example`` folder for demonstration purposes.

## Accessibility

ngDialog supports accessible keyboard navigation via the ``trapFocus`` and ``preserveFocus`` options.

The ``role``, ``aria-labelledby`` and ``aria-describedby`` attributes are also supported, and are rendered as follows.

Dialog ``role`` attribute:

* ``options.ariaRole``, if specified
* "dialog" if ``options.ariaAuto`` is ``true`` and the dialog contains any focusable elements
* "alertdialog" is ``options.ariaAuto`` is ``true`` and the dialog does *not* contain any focusable elements

Dialog ``aria-labelledby`` attribute:

* ``options.ariaLabelledById``, if specified
* If ``options.ariaLabelledBySelector`` is specified, the first matching element will be found and assigned an id (if required) and that id will be used
* If ``options.ariaAuto`` is ``true``, the first heading element in the dialog (h1-6) will be found and processed as per ``ariaLabelledBySelector``

Dialog ``aria-describedby`` attribute:

* ``options.ariaDescribedById``, if specified
* If ``options.ariaDescribedBySelector`` is specified, the first matching element will be found and assigned an id (if required) and that id will be used
* If ``options.ariaAuto`` is ``true``, the first content element in the dialog (article,section,p) will be found and processed as per ``ariaDescribedBySelector``

Dialog Content ``role`` attribute:

* Always assigned a value of "document"
